**Running Elasticsearch üê≥** <br/>
This project uses Docker to run a local, single-node Elasticsearch cluster for development.

**Prerequisites** <br/>
You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
The docker-compose.yml file required to run the container is included in the root of this project.

**How to Start the Service** <br/>
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project (where the docker-compose.yml file is located). <br/>
Run the following command to start the Elasticsearch container in the background: <br/>
docker-compose up -d <br/>
To Verify It's Running wait a few moments for the container to initialize.<br/>
To confirm that Elasticsearch is running correctly, execute this command in postman : http://localhost:9200<br/>
You should receive a JSON response with details about the cluster, similar to this:

**Application Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è** <br/>
The application is configured with defaults that work out-of-the-box with the provided Docker setup.

**All configuration properties are located in the following file:**
src/main/resources/application.properties

**Data Ingestion & Verification üíæ** <br/>

**Triggering Ingestion** <br/>
The sample data, located at src/main/resources/sample-courses.json, is automatically ingested into Elasticsearch. This process is handled by the DataInitializer component and runs only the first time the Spring Boot application starts with an empty Elasticsearch instance.<br/>

If the courses index already exists, the data ingestion is skipped to prevent creating duplicate documents on subsequent application restarts.

**Verifying Ingestion** <br/>
You can verify that the data has been successfully loaded by querying Elasticsearch in PostMan.

**1. Check the Document Count**<br/>
To get a quick count of all documents in the courses index, run the following command:
we wil run the command : localhost:9200/courses/_count

We will run the command localhost:9200/courses/_search?pretty to view 10 course documents from the index and confirm that the total hits is 50.

**API Usage Examples (Postman) üß™**<br/>

Basic Setup:
Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request type to GET.
Set the URL to: http://localhost:8080/api/search
Use the "Params" tab (located below the URL bar) to add the keys and values for each example.

Example 1: Full-Text Search for "Java"
Action: In the "Params" tab, add one row:
Key: q
Value: Java
Expected Behavior: The response will include courses with "Java" in their title or description, such as "Advanced Java Concepts"
